# UofAPrereqs This is mine and Andrew Rooney's project for the 2019 HackED 24H hackathon.
This is a web application that crawls the ualberta course catalogue and builds a tree of prerequisite dependencies.
Users are able to query to get a tree representation of the prerequisites for a course. Data processing is done in python, and the visualization is achieved using D3.
